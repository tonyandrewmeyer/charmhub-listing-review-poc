Reviewer: Please review the charm, **within three working days** by checking each of the items in the following checklist. If blocking issues are found, please help the author work through those, and respond to any follow-up posts within *one working day*.

If you find other improvements or fixes that could be made to the charm, feel free to suggest those, but **they do not block listing**. If you find something that's missing from the review checklist or best practices, please separately suggest that (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)) so that we can keep the review process consistent.

See the [README](../README.md) for more information about the charm listing review process.

When reviewing test coverage of the charm, note that:

* Unit tests are recommended, but *not* required.
* A minimal set of integration tests is required, as outlined in the checklist.
* There is no minimum for test coverage. We suggest that tests cover at least all configuration options and actions, as well as the observed Juju events, but this is not a requirement for listing.
* Some charms may have additional tests in an external location, particularly if the charm has specific resource requirements (such as specific hardware).

<details>
<summary>Reviewer: copy this list of requirements to a separate comment</summary>

```
## Listing requirements

* [ ] The charm does what it is meant to do, per the [demo or tutorial]({demo_url}).
* [ ] The [charm's page on Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/{name}) provides a quality impression. The overall appearance looks good and the [documentation]({documentation_link}) looks reasonable.
* [ ] The charm has an icon.
* [ ] [Automated releasing]({ci_release_url}) to unstable channels exists
* [ ] [Integration tests]({ci_integration_url}) exist, are run on every change to the default branch, and are passing. At minimum, the tests verify that the charm can be deployed and ends up in a success state, and that the charm can be integrated with at least one example for each 'provides' and 'requires' specified (including optional, excluding tracing) ending up in a success state. The tests should be run with `charmcraft test`.

### Documentation

A charm's documentation should focus on the charm itself. For workload-specific or Juju-related content, link to the appropriate upstream documentation. A smaller charm can have single-page documentation for its description. A bigger charm should include a full Diátaxis navigation tree. Check that the charm has documentation that covers:
* [ ] How to use the charm, including configuration, limitations, and deviations in behaviour from the “non-charmed” version of the application.
* [ ] How to modify the charm
* [ ] A concise summary of the charm in the `charmcraft.yaml` 'summary' field, and a more detailed description in the `charmcraft.yaml` 'description' field.
