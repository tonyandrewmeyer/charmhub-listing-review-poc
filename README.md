# Requests for public listing on charmhub.io

Charms on [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io) are either privately listed, meaning
that they can be deployed and their page viewed only if you know the name of the
charm, or publicly listed, meaning that they can be found when searching (either
on Charmhub itself or a more general web search leading to Charmhub).

Anyone can publish a charm to Charmhub, and when first published it will be
privately listed. To change the charm to be publicly listed requires passing a
lightweight review process to ensure charm consistency and quality. This is a
one-off process (in most circumstances), not done for each revision of a charm.

Reviewing charms encourages the involvement of the community. The community
refers to individuals and organisations creating or contributing to charms,
Juju, and the wider charming ecosystem. The goals of the review are:

1. Be transparent about the capabilities and qualities of a charm.
2. Ensure a common level of quality.

A listing review is *not* code review. The reviewer may be looking at some of
the charm code, and may have comments on it, but the listing review is not a
review of the architecture or design of the charm, and is not a line-by-line
review of the charm code.

This repository contains:

* Issues that are requests for changing a charm to be publicly listed.
* Infrastructure to support the review process (such as automatically assigning
  reviews, tools to check some criteria automatically, and so on).

## Steps of a review

1. The author requests a review for *one* charm at a time with all prerequisites
   using a [listing request issue](https://github.com/canonical/charmhub-listing-review/issues/new)
   in this repository.
2. The reviewer checks if the prerequisites are met and the pull request is
   ready.
3. The public review is carried out as a conversation on the pull request.
4. The review concludes if the charm is 'publication ready', and if so the store
   team is asked to list the charm.

The result of the process is that:
* if the review is successful, the charm is switched to listed mode, or
* if the review is unsuccessful, the charm does not reach the required criteria
  and the charm remains unlisted, until the issues are resolved.

## Get ready

Read the [documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/ops/latest/howto/request-public-listing/)
for detailed information about publicly listed charms, the review process, and
the criteria for public listing.

You can also use the tooling from this repository to see how close the charm is
to passing a review. Note that some of the criteria can be checked automatically
(and those will be when running the tool), but others will be manually checked
by the reviewer (so you will need to evaluate readiness in those areas
yourself).

## Get started

If the charm is ready for review,
[open an issue in this repository](https://github.com/canonical/charmhub-listing-review/issues/new).
